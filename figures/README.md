# Figures Directory

This directory is reserved for optional generated figures (e.g., cost curves,
threshold trade-off plots, regime diagrams) used for paper submission or presentation.

By design, this repository follows a text-first reporting strategy.
All primary empirical results are reported in:

- `RESULTS.md`
- `RESULTS_NUMBERS.md`

Figures are generated from notebooks in `notebooks/` and are not committed by default
to avoid storing derived artifacts.

Figures may be added here if required for external submission.
